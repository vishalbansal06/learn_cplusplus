Notes for c++:
1. Intialization:
int a(3.14); // which one is okay,
int b{3.14}; // and which is an error?
Iâ€™ve always used curly braces to initialize a variable, but parentheses also work as long as you provide at least one argument. 
You also pay a cost in safety. The compiler allows conversions that lose information, such as floating-point to integer, 
when you use parentheses for initialization, but it reports an error when you use curly braces.
